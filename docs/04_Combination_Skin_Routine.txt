Combination Skin Routine â€“ Mini-Guide Combination skin has both oily and dry areas, usually an oily T-zone (forehead, nose, chin) and dry cheeks. This guide balances both concerns.

Cleansing: Use a mild gel cleanser to remove excess oil without stripping drier areas. Apply salicylic acid or niacinamide on oily areas; hydrating serums on dry patches.

Choose a lightweight lotion that hydrates without greasiness. Apply sunscreen that is lightweight but moisturizing.
