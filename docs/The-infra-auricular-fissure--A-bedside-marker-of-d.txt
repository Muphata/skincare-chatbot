Tools exist to assess disease severity for experimentalstudies; these tools are not practical in a high-volumeclinical setting. 1Thus, a simple bedside marker of AD severity would be a useful addition to the armamen-tarium of AD management. The presence of an infra-auricular ﬁssure in patients with AD has been previously noted. 2-5 Although these studies have examined the preva-lence of the infra-auricular fissure, its definitionvaries substantially between studies. In addition, toour knowledge, no previous study has correlated theseverity of the fissure with AD severity. Therefore,the goal of the current study was to determine if theseverity of the infra-auricular fissure can be used as a bedside marker for AD and associated itch severity. Further, we wanted to determine whether thismarker correlates with other validated tools ofeczema severity such as the Eczema Area andSeverity Index (EASI) and Investigator’s GlobalAssessment (IGA). Patients presented to the Wake Forest Dermatology Clinic, Winston-Salem, NC, between July 2010 and January 2011 with a clinical diagnosis of AD as deﬁned by Haniﬁn and Rajka. 6Patients withdemonstrated infra-auricular fissures and no additional dermatologic conditions other than AD were included as subjects. Infra-auricular fissure assess-ment was based on fissure depth, erythema, scaling,and oozing/crusting (Fig 1 ). Infra-auricular scoring was performed by two physician researchers notdirectly involved in the care of the patient; assess-ment of EASI and IGA scores was used to measureAD severity. Patients 7 years of age or older were asked to rate on a numerical visual analog scale of 1 to 10 theiraverage itch intensity during the last week. Patientsyounger than 7 years had itch intensity assessed byasking parents to rate their child’s itch. A subset ofpatients was followed up in clinic between 1 to 2months after the initial visit. At this visit, EASI score,IGA score, itch intensity, and infra-auricular fissure score were reassessed. All analyses were performed using Spearman correlation to analyze the relationship of infraauricular ﬁssure score with EASI score, IGA score,and itch intensity. Wilcoxon signed rank test evalu-ated differences between ﬁrst and second visitparameters. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at Pless than .05. In all, 81 patients (48 male, 33 female) with a mean age of 7.5 (range 1-61) years were enrolled. Patientswere Caucasian (44), African American (20),Hispanic (9), and Asian (8). The percentages ofpatients with an infra-auricular ﬁssure score of 1, 2,and 3 were 58%, 27%, and 15%, respectively. A high correlation coefﬁcient was found between infra-auricular ﬁssure score and EASI score (0.6, P\ .001) during the first patient visit (Fig 2 ). Similarly, of the 29 patients who returned for a follow-up visitafter 1 to 2 months, the correlation coefficientbetween infra-auricular fissure score and EASI andIGA scores were 0.4 (P \.05) and 0.5 (P \.01), respectively. No correlation was found between visual analog scale scores of itch intensity and infra-auricular ﬁssure score during the initial visit. However, of the 29 patients who returned, the correlation coef-ﬁcient between infra-auricular ﬁssure score andvisual analog scale scores for itch intensity was 0.6(P\.01). These patients experienced a mean improvement in fissure score (1.6-0.8) associatedwith a significant reduction in EASI score, IGAscore, and itch intensity. This study demonstrates that the infra-auricular ﬁssure can be used as a bedside tool to assess theseverity of AD. Speciﬁcally, the results of the studyimply a direct correlation between the appearance ofthe infra-auricular ﬁssure with AD severity. Thistool’s utility is underscored by its presence amongJAMACADDERMATOL VOLUME 66, N UMBER 6Letters 1009 patients of all ages, both genders, and all ethnic groups since AD presents differently in infancy,childhood, and adulthood and has various ethnicpresentations. 4 In conclusion, in patients with AD in whom the infra-auricular ﬁssure is present, the severity of theﬁssure may serve as an easy and convenient bedside marker for disease activity.
