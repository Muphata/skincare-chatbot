Double cleansing removes makeup, sunscreen, and impurities, especially useful at night.
Use an oil-based cleanser to dissolve makeup/sunscreen. Follow with a gentle foaming cleanser. Rinse with lukewarm water and pat dry.

Continue with your routine.

Tips:
- Great for oily and combination skin.
- Micellar water can replace the first step for sensitive skin.
- Do it only at night if skin is dry.

Avoid harsh foaming cleansers that strip oils. Over-cleansing may lead to dryness.
