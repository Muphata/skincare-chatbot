Post-Makeup Skincare Removing makeup properly prevents clogged pores and irritation.
Use oil-based cleansers or micellar water to remove makeup. Follow with a gentle cleanser. Apply soothing toner or serum.
Moisturize to restore hydration. Double cleansing is essential for heavy makeup.  Use cotton pads gently to avoid tugging. Night masks can refresh tired skin.


Sleeping with makeup accelerates aging. Harsh scrubbing causes microtears in skin.
