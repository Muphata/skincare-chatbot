Anti-Pollution Skincare – Mini-Guide
Pollution contributes to premature aging, pigmentation, and dullness. Skincare can help reduce its effects. Cleanse skin thoroughly every evening. Apply antioxidant serums (vitamin C, E, resveratrol). Use barrier-strengthening moisturizers with ceramides.
Protect with sunscreen daily.

double cleanse if exposed to heavy pollution. Wipe face with micellar water during the day if outside long hours. Keep indoor air clean with filters or plants.

Don’t over-cleanse, as this strips the skin. Chronic irritation may need professional advice.
