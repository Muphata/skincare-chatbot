Skincare for Back Acne Back acne (bacne) is common due to sweat, oil, and friction. A targeted routine helps. Shower after sweating or workouts.  Use body washes with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Moisturize with non-comedogenic lotions. Wear breathable fabrics.

Change sheets and workout clothes often. Exfoliate with gentle scrubs once weekly.
- Spot treat with acne gels as needed. Avoid oily body creams.
- Severe or cystic bacne may require dermatologist treatment.
