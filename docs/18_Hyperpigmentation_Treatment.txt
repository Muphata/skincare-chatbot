Hyperpigmentation includes dark spots caused by sun, acne scars, or hormonal changes. Treating it requires patience and consistency. Cleanse gently to avoid irritation. Apply targeted treatments with ingredients like niacinamide, vitamin C, or azelaic acid. Moisturize to maintain barrier function. Use sunscreen daily to prevent worsening. Nighttime retinoids can help fade dark spots.

- Combine brightening serums with antioxidants for best effect.
- Avoid sun exposure during peak hours.

Warnings:
- Avoid hydroquinone unless prescribed.
- Laser treatments should be performed only by professionals.
