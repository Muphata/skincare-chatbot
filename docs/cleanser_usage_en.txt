Topic: How to Use a Cleanser

Cleansers are designed to remove dirt, oil, sunscreen, and impurities from the skin.

How to use:
1. Wet your face with lukewarm water.
2. Apply a small amount of cleanser to damp hands.
3. Massage gently into the skin for 30–60 seconds.
4. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water.
5. Pat dry with a soft towel (do not rub).

Best times:
- Morning: to refresh skin and remove overnight oil.
- Evening: to remove sunscreen, makeup, and pollutants.
- For most skin types, 1–2 times per day is enough.

Tips:
- Use a gentle, low-pH cleanser if you have dry or sensitive skin.
- Avoid washing too often, which can disrupt the skin barrier.
- Do not use hot water — it can strip natural oils.
