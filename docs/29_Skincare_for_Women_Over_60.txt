Skin over 60 tends to be thinner, drier, and more sensitive. Gentle, nourishing care is essential.

Use mild, hydrating cleansers. Apply serums with peptides and antioxidants.
Moisturize heavily with thick creams or balms. Use mineral sunscreen daily.

Stay hydrated and maintain a nutrient-rich diet. Use humidifiers to combat dryness. Gentle facial massage promotes circulation.

Avoid over-exfoliating fragile skin. Persistent sores or lesions should be checked by a doctor.
