Toners balance pH and remove residue; essences hydrate and prep skin for serums.
Apply toner with cotton pad after cleansing.
Pat essence into skin using hands.
Continue with serum and moisturizer.
 Use morning and night as needed.

Choose hydrating toners with hyaluronic acid. Exfoliating toners should be used sparingly. Essences add an extra hydration layer in dry climates.

Alcohol-based toners can be too harsh. Overusing exfoliating toners may cause irritation.
