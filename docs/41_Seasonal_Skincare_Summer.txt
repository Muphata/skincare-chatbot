Seasonal Skincare: Summer 
Summer heat and humidity increase oil production and sun exposure risk. A lighter routine works best.

Use a foaming or gel cleanser to reduce oil.Apply lightweight serums like niacinamide.
 Moisturize with gel-based formulas.Use SPF 50 and reapply every 2 hours.

Blotting papers help control shine. Wear hats and sunglasses outdoors.
After-sun gels soothe minor burns. 

Donâ€™t rely only on makeup SPF. Overuse of harsh cleansers causes rebound oiliness.
