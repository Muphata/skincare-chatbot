healthy scalp is the foundation for healthy hair. Issues include dandruff, oiliness, and sensitivity. Wash with a suitable shampoo for your scalp type.
2. Exfoliate gently with scalp scrubs or brushes once a week. Apply nourishing oils like jojoba or tea tree (if tolerated).
Protect scalp from sun with hats or sunscreen sprays. Avoid washing with very hot water. Massage scalp to stimulate circulation. Switch shampoos if dandruff persists.

Donâ€™t overuse harsh medicated shampoos. Persistent itching or hair loss needs medical evaluation.
