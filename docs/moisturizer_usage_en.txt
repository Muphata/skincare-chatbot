Topic: How to Use a Moisturizer

Moisturizers hydrate the skin and lock in water.

Steps:
1. Apply after cleansing and serums.
2. Use gentle upward strokes.
3. Morning: apply before sunscreen.
4. Evening: apply as last step of routine.

Tips:
- Lightweight gel/lotion for oily skin.
- Rich cream with ceramides/occlusives for dry skin.
- Choose fragrance-free for sensitive skin.
