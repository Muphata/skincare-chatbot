Dry Skin Routine â€“ Mini-Guide

Introduction:
Dry skin lacks sufficient natural oils and moisture, leading to tightness, flakiness, and sometimes irritation. This guide provides a gentle, hydrating routine.

Steps:
1. Cleansing: Use a cream or oil-based cleanser that does not strip natural oils.
2. Treatment: Apply a hydrating serum containing hyaluronic acid or glycerin.
3. Moisturizing: Use a rich, emollient moisturizer with ceramides or shea butter.
4. Protection: Always apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with added moisturizing agents.

Tips:
- Avoid hot showers, as they worsen dryness.
- Use a humidifier in dry climates or during winter.
- Reapply moisturizer during the day if your skin feels tight.

Warnings:
- Stay away from alcohol-based toners or harsh foaming cleansers.
- If dryness causes cracks, redness, or pain, consult a dermatologist.
