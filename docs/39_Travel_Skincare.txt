Travel exposes skin to climate changes, airplane air, and stress. A simplified routine helps maintain balance.

Carry travel-size cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Hydrate with sheet masks during long flights. Apply lip balm frequently. Use SPF even when sightseeing.

Pack multi-purpose products to save space. Drink plenty of water while traveling. Keep antibacterial wipes for quick cleansing.
Avoid trying new products while traveling. Airplane cabin air can worsen eczema and dryness.
