Sunburn damages skin cells and increases long-term cancer risk. Recovery requires gentle, soothing steps.

Cool skin with cold compresses or aloe vera gel. Moisturize with fragrance-free creams frequently. Drink extra water to rehydrate. Avoid further sun exposure until healed. Take cool showers instead of hot. Wear loose cotton clothing.
- Use over-the-counter pain relievers for discomfort.

Avoid peeling or picking at burned skin. Severe burns with blisters or fever require urgent care.
