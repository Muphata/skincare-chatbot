Oily Skin Routine – Mini-Guide

oily skin produces excess sebum, leading to shine, clogged pores, and frequent breakouts. This guide outlines a routine that balances oil while protecting the skin barrier.

Cleansing: Use a gentle foaming or gel-based cleanser twice daily. Apply active ingredients like salicylic acid or niacinamide to control oil and reduce acne.
Choose a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer with a non-comedogenic formula. Apply a broad-spectrum, mattifying sunscreen that won’t clog pores.

Blotting papers can help control shine during the day. Avoid over-cleansing, which can trigger more oil production. Incorporate clay masks once a week to absorb excess oil.

Warnings:
- Avoid heavy creams and oils that may clog pores.
- Persistent cystic acne or severe breakouts should be evaluated by a dermatologist.
