Acne Management â€“ Mini-Guide


Acne is caused by clogged pores, oil overproduction, and inflammation. This guide offers a basic routine to reduce breakouts.
Cleansing: Wash twice daily with a gentle, salicylic acid-based cleanser. Apply benzoyl peroxide or adapalene (retinoid) on affected areas. Use a light, non-comedogenic moisturizer to prevent irritation. Use sunscreen daily, since acne treatments make skin sun-sensitive.
