Sheet masks deliver concentrated hydration and actives quickly. This guide shows how to use them safely. Cleanse your face before applying a mask. Place the sheet mask on for 10–20 minutes. Pat excess serum into the skin after removing. Follow with moisturizer to lock in benefits. Store masks in the fridge for a cooling effect. Use 1–3 times per week, depending on skin needs.

Different masks target hydration, brightening, or soothing. Avoid leaving masks on too long; they can dry out skin. Stop use if irritation or burning occurs.
