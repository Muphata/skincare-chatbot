Skincare for Neck and Décolletage  The neck and chest age quickly due to sun exposure and thin skin. This area needs special care.

Cleanse gently with face cleanser. Apply serums (vitamin C, peptides) daily.
Moisturize with rich creams. Use SPF generously.

Extend all face skincare down to chest. Sleep on your back to reduce wrinkles.  Hydrating sheet masks can be used on this area.

Avoid ignoring this area in your routine. Be gentle—skin here is thinner than the face.
