Retinol 
Retinol (vitamin A derivative) boosts cell turnover, improves fine lines, and treats acne. Proper introduction prevents irritation. Start with a pea-sized amount, 2–3 times per week. Apply at night after cleansing and before moisturizer.  Gradually increase frequency as tolerance builds. Always use sunscreen during the day. Sandwich method: apply moisturizer before and after retinol to reduce irritation. Pair with hydrating serums (hyaluronic acid).

Start with low concentration (0.25–0.5%). Avoid mixing with benzoyl peroxide or strong acids. Not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
