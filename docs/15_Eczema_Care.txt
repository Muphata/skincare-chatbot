Eczema Care 
Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a chronic skin condition causing dryness, itching, and flares. Barrier repair is key.

Use fragrance-free, soap-free cleansers. Apply thick emollients (ointment or cream) twice daily. Treat flares with medicated creams as prescribed.
Avoid known triggers (dust, wool, harsh soaps). 
Tips:
- Take short, lukewarm showers.
- Apply moisturizer immediately after bathing.
- Use cotton clothing instead of irritating fabrics.


Avoid scratching to prevent infection. and Severe or widespread eczema needs medical care.
