minimalist routine reduces risk of irritation and saves time. Focus is on essentials. Cleanse once or twice daily. Apply a simple moisturizer.
Use sunscreen every morning. Stick to 3–4 products max.

Choose multi-tasking products (moisturizer + SPF). Works well for sensitive or acne-prone skin.

don’t skip sunscreen, even with minimal routines. Watch for hidden fragrances in "simple" products.
