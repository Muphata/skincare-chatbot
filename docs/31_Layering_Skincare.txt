layering products in the right order ensures maximum benefits and prevents conflicts. Start with cleanser. Apply lightweight serums (vitamin C, niacinamide).
Follow with treatments (retinol at night). Seal with moisturizer. Finish with sunscreen in the morning.

Apply thinnest to thickest products. Use water-based serums before oil-based.
- Introduce new products one at a time. Avoid layering too many strong actives at once. Mixing acids and retinoids may irritate skin.
