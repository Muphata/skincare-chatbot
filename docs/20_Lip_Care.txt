Lip Care
Lips lack oil glands, making them prone to dryness and cracking. This guide provides simple care steps.
Exfoliate gently with a sugar scrub once a week. Apply lip balm with beeswax, shea butter, or lanolin. Use lip products containing SPF for sun protection. and Stay hydrated throughout the day.

Avoid licking your lips—it worsens dryness. Apply balm before bed for overnight repair. Use a humidifier in dry environments. Don’t use harsh scrubs on lips. Persistent cracks may indicate infection or deficiency.
