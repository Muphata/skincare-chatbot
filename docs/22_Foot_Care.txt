Foot Care 
Feet endure daily stress, leading to calluses, dryness, and sometimes fungal infections. Proper care keeps them healthy. Soak feet in warm water weekly for relaxation. Exfoliate with a pumice stone to remove calluses. Apply thick cream or petroleum jelly at night. Wear breathable socks and shoes.
Sprinkle antifungal powder if prone to infections. Trim toenails straight across to prevent ingrown nails. Massage feet to improve circulation.
Avoid cutting calluses with blades. Diabetics should consult doctors for foot issues.
