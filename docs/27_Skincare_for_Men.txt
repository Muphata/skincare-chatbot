Skincare for Men
Men’s skin tends to be thicker and oilier, with unique needs due to shaving. This guide simplifies daily care. Cleanse with a gel cleanser to remove oil and dirt.
 Shave with a hydrating shaving cream; follow with aftershave balm.

Moisturize with a lightweight gel or lotion. Use sunscreen daily, especially on face and neck.

Exfoliate 1–2 times weekly to prevent ingrown hairs. Choose fragrance-free aftershaves to reduce irritation. Hydrate well after workouts.
Avoid alcohol-heavy aftershaves. Persistent razor bumps may need professional treatment.
