What are bacterial skin infections?
Skin infections can be caused by bacteria (often Staphylococcal or Streptococcal) either invading normal skin, or affecting a compromised skin barrier (eg, skin affected by atopic dermatitis, or surgical wound sites).

The skin is our first line of protection against the environment. A local or systemic response is activated when this protective barrier is invaded. Microorganisms that invade the skin can be part of the external environment or the normal skin microbiome.
Who gets bacterial skin infections?
Bacterial

 skin infections are a common reason for emergency visits. Children under five years and adults over 65 years old are affected more often than other age groups. In 2005, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported a high prevalence of skin disease in children from developing

 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Gender may also play a role; in one North American study, men comprised 60-70% of all cases of cellulitis.

Certain comorbid conditions increase susceptibility to bacterial skin infections, such as diabetes, vascular insufficiency, and being immunocompromised (eg, chemotherapy patients with neutropaenia). Some people, such as those who inject drugs, are at increased risk. Among hospitalised patients, skin infections are prevalent and often complicate the hospital course.

What are the clinical features of bacterial skin infections?
Bacterial skin infections can result in diverse clinical presentations. Generally, they will present with erythema, pain, warmth, swelling, and, depending on severity, dysfunction. Purulent discharge and lymphadenopathy may also be evident on examination.

In severe infections, the following signs may be present:

Temperature instability (higher than 38⁰C or lower than 35⁰C)
Tachycardia
Altered mental status
Rapid progression of infection
Haemorrhagic or violaceous bullae
Signs of necrosis
Crepitus.
How do clinical features vary in differing types of skin?
Erythema may be less evident in darker skin tones, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is more common.

What are the complications of bacterial skin infections?
Skin breakdown
Abscess formation
Sepsis (can be life-threatening)
Septic emboli
Scarring or postinflammatory hyperpigmentation
Rheumatic fever (may result from Streptococcal skin infection)
Recurrent infection
Infections due to resistant bacteria (eg, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus/MRSA) may be more difficult to treat.
How are bacterial skin infections diagnosed?
Bacterial skin infection is commonly diagnosed clinically, although laboratory studies may be useful, such as:

Full blood count: bacterial infection often raises the white cell and neutrophil count
C-reactive protein (CRP): elevated >50 in serious bacterial infections (note there can be a delay of >24 hours between onset of symptoms and CRP rise)
Procalcitonin: blood test marker for generalised sepsis due to bacterial infection
Blood culture: if fever (>38⁰C)
Swab of the skin lesion/s sent for microscopy, culture, and sensitivities.
What is the differential diagnosis for bacterial skin infection?
Superficial thrombophlebitis
Deep venous thrombosis
Contact dermatitis
Pustular psoriasis
Drug reactions
Vasculitides
Erythema nodosum
Viral skin infection
Fungal skin infection
How do you prevent bacterial skin infections?
Regular hand washing, especially before and after touching broken skin.
General lifestyle factors to improve overall health and immune function (eg, weight management if overweight or underweight, smoking cessation, reducing alcohol intake).
Optimising management of other medical conditions (eg, diabetic control).
Maintaining skin barrier (eg, through appropriate management of atopic dermatitis, and skin irritant/allergen avoidance).
What is the treatment for bacterial skin infections?
Minor bacterial infections often resolve without treatment. Due to increasing antibiotic resistance, first-line use of topical antibiotics, such as fusidic acid, is generally discouraged; topical antiseptics are often used as an alternative for minor infections. More serious or persistent bacterial infections are treated with oral, intravenous, or sometimes intramuscular antibiotics.

It is best to take samples (eg, swabs or blood cultures) to test which organism is responsible for an infection before commencing antibiotics. If the infection is serious (eg, suspected meningococcal disease), do not delay treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. As culture and sensitivities become available, change to an appropriate narrow-spectrum antibiotic.

Antibiotics should not be prescribed if they are not indicated or unlikely to be of benefit, for example, if the infection is viral in origin. Adverse reactions include cutaneous effects and gastrointestinal side effects. Antibiotic stewardship is also an important consideration.

What is the outcome for bacterial skin infections?
Many bacterial skin infections resolve without treatment or without serious morbidity. However, skin infections can be severe and cause a significant burden of disease worldwide, sometimes resulting in sepsis and death, particularly in vulnerable patient groups such as the elderly, hospitalised, and immunocompromised.

Antibiotic resistance has increasing implications for the treatability and outcome of many bacterial skin infections moving forwards.
