hands show early signs of aging and are prone to dryness due to frequent washing. A consistent routine helps.
Wash with gentle, moisturizing soaps. Apply hand cream after each wash.
Use gloves when cleaning or handling chemicals. Protect with SPF outdoors.

Tips:
- Keep a travel-sized hand cream handy.
- Overnight cotton gloves help creams absorb better.
- Choose fragrance-free formulas if sensitive.

Avoid hot water for washing hands. Persistent eczema on hands should be checked by a dermatologist.
