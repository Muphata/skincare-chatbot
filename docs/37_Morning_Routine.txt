morning skincare preps your skin for the day, focusing on hydration and protection.

1. Cleanse lightly or just rinse with water.
2. Apply antioxidant serum (vitamin C).
3. Moisturize with a lightweight cream.
4. Apply sunscreen as the final step.

Layer sunscreen under makeup for full coverage. Keep routines simple in the morning. Reapply SPF if outside for long hours.

Donâ€™t skip SPF even if staying indoors. Avoid strong actives like retinol in the morning.
