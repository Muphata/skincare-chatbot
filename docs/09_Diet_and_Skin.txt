Nutrition plays a vital role in skin appearance and function. This guide highlights key nutrients that promote healthy skin.

1. Eat foods rich in omega-3 (salmon, flaxseed) to reduce inflammation.
2. Consume antioxidants like vitamin C (citrus fruits) and E (nuts).
3. Include zinc-rich foods (pumpkin seeds, beans) for healing.
4. Limit processed foods and excess sugar to avoid breakouts. Balance diet with whole grains, lean protein, and fresh vegetables. Probiotics (yogurt, kefir) support skin by balancing gut health. Hydration and nutrition work together for optimal results. Extreme diets may cause deficiencies that harm skin.
- Supplements should not replace balanced meals without medical advice.
