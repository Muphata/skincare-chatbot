Seasonal Skincare cold weather reduces humidity, causing dryness and irritation. Adjust skincare for winter. Switch to cream or balm cleansers. Apply rich moisturizers twice daily. Use overnight hydrating masks. Continue sunscreen daily.

Run a humidifier indoors. Wear gloves and scarves to protect skin. Apply hand cream frequently. 
Avoid hot showers that strip oils. Windburn needs soothing balms, not scrubs.
