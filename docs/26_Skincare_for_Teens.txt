Skincare for Teens 
Teen skin is often oily and prone to acne due to hormonal changes. A simple, consistent routine works best.  cleanse twice daily with a mild foaming cleanser.
Spot-treat pimples with benzoyl peroxide.

Moisturize with an oil-free lotion. Always apply sunscreen before going out.


- Don’t pop pimples to avoid scars. Use blotting papers for shine control.


Stick to 3–4 products; more is not better. Avoid heavy makeup that clogs pores.

Severe acne should be treated by a dermatologist.
