Serums are concentrated treatments targeting specific skin concerns. They absorb deeply for maximum effect.

Apply after cleansing and before moisturizing. Use antioxidants in the morning (vitamin C). Apply retinoids or hydrating serums at night.

Follow with moisturizer to lock in. Layer serums by consistency: watery first.
- Stick to one or two active serums at a time. Store vitamin C serums in dark bottles.

Warnings:
- Mixing incompatible serums (retinol + strong acids) may irritate. Overusing actives can damage skin barrier.
