Skincare Habits: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Q1: How often should I wash my face?
A: Wash your face twice a day—once in the morning and once at night. You should also wash your face immediately after sweating, such as after a workout, to prevent clogged pores. Over-washing can strip your skin of its natural oils, leading to dryness or increased oil production.


Q2: Do I really need to use sunscreen every day?
A: Yes, absolutely. Sunscreen is the most effective anti-aging product and a crucial part of skin cancer prevention. You should apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day, regardless of the weather. UV rays can penetrate clouds and even glass.



Q3: Is it bad to pop my pimples?
A: Yes, avoid popping pimples. Doing so can push bacteria deeper into the skin, leading to more inflammation, infection, and potentially long-lasting scars. It's best to use targeted acne treatments with ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.


Q4: Should I moisturize if I have oily skin?
A: Yes. Moisturizing is essential for all skin types, including oily skin. When oily skin is dehydrated, it can over-produce oil to compensate, making the problem worse. Choose a lightweight, oil-free, or gel-based moisturizer that won't clog your pores.


Q5: What is the correct order to apply my products?
A: A good rule of thumb is to apply products from the thinnest consistency to the thickest. A basic routine would look like this:

Cleanser: To wash your face.

Toner/Serum: A lightweight liquid or gel with targeted ingredients.

Moisturizer: To hydrate and seal in your serums.

Sunscreen: The final step for your morning routine.

Q6: Are expensive products always better?
A: No, a high price tag does not guarantee effectiveness. The most important thing is to focus on a product's active ingredients and whether they are suitable for your specific skin type and concerns. Many affordable products contain the same effective ingredients as their luxury counterparts.

Q7: How often should I exfoliate?
A: Exfoliation should be done gently and in moderation. Over-exfoliating can damage your skin's protective barrier, leading to irritation, redness, and sensitivity. Most dermatologists recommend exfoliating 1-3 times per week, depending on your skin type and the type of exfoliant you use.


Q8: What's the difference between dry skin and dehydrated skin?
A: This is a common point of confusion. Dry skin is a skin type that lacks natural oils (lipids) and often feels tight, flaky, or rough. Dehydrated skin is a temporary condition that lacks water and can affect any skin type (even oily skin). It often feels tight and can look dull or have fine lines. The treatment for each is different: dry skin needs oil-based moisturizers, while dehydrated skin needs water-based products with ingredients like hyaluronic acid.
Myths and misconceptions are never-ending when it comes to skincare. Whether whispered in online communities or discussed by beauty-savvy individuals skincare myths when not debunked can sabotage your quest for flawless glowing skin. Let the experts at Earthraga bust the most common skincare myths and arm you with science-backed facts. 

Debunking Common Skincare Myths 
When you separate fact from fiction, you build a skincare routine that’s perfect for your skin needs. Let’s check what are some common skin care myths. 

Myth 1 - “You Don’t Need Sunscreen on Cloudy Days”
Truth: Around 80% of the UV rays of the sun can penetrate through the cloud cover, thus not using sunscreen on cloudy days can risk tanning, aging, dryness, and more. Using a sunscreen is important even on cloudy days. 

Myth 2 - “Oily Skin Doesn’t Need Moisturization”
Truth: Skipping moisturizer will not make the skin feel less oily. On the contrary, the skin will produce excess sebum due to dehydration. Opt for lightweight, non-comedogenic gel moisturizers for oily skin. You can opt for beneficial ingredients like hyaluronic acid or niacinamide to balance hydration without clogging pores. 

Myth 3 - “Exfoliate Daily for Smooth Skin”
Truth: Over-exfoliation destroys your skin barrier and can lead to redness, sensitivity, and breakout. Avoid using physical face scrubs (walnut/almond) or chemical scrubs (AHA/BHA) every day. Use gentle face scrubs not more than 2-3 times a week for glowing skin. 

Myth 4 - “Acne is a Teenage Problem”
Truth: Pimples do not vanish once you hit your 20s. Adult acne is real and can occur in people in their 30s and 40s too. Hormonal fluctuations, stress, pollution, and sun damage are factors for adult acne. You need targeted ingredients like salicylic acid face serum to treat acne. 

Myth 5 - “Expensive Products Work Better”
Truth: A hefty price tag doesn’t always mean a superior product. More than the price tag of the product look for quality ingredients. Luxury brands may feel indulgent but they are not always effective. Instead of checking the price, look for science-backed formulas and superior ingredients like niacinamide, retinol, Hyaluronic acid, ceramides, peptides, and more. Focus on the ingredient list and not the logo! 

Myth 6 - “Popping Pimple will Heal Faster”
Truth: Squeezing zits won’t clear them, you will risk pushing bacteria deeper inside the layers of the skin instead. Bacteria can cause inflammation, scarring, and more breakouts. Instead apply functional acne products like acne patches, salicylic acid serum, or spot treatment creams. 

Myth 7 - “All Skin Types Can Have Same Routine”
Truth: Skincare is not one-size-fits-all. Your skin is as unique as your fingerprint. While dry skin craves deep hydration, oily skin thrives best with gel moisturizers. Similarly, matured skin needs ingredients that boost collagen, and sensitive skin requires fragrance-free formula. Listen to your skin’s needs and adjust your skincare regimen. 

Myth 8 - “You Don’t Need Anti-Aging Products Until You’re 30+”
Truth: Prevention is the key! Sun damage and environmental stress are inevitable in today’s world. These are the key reasons for collagen breakdown in your 20s. Use ba road-spectrum sunscreen with hydrating ingredients to protect your skin against premature aging. Use hydrating night creams with ingredients like niacinamide and hyaluronic acid for hydration. 

Myth 9 - “All Dark Spots Are Hyperpigmentation”
Truth: Every dark spot is not hyper-pigmentation. You might get a dark spot on your skin for various reasons - acne marks, sun spots, and more. Protecting your skin every day with sunscreen is vital. However, hyperpigmentation might signal underlying issues like hormonal imbalance, melasma, etc. Consult a dermatologist to identify the cause and tailor treatments. 

Myth 10 - “Drinking Water Alone Hydrates Your Skin”
Truth: Drinking enough water is good for proper body function, however, topical moisturizers (with occlusives like ceramides) are essential to lock in moisture. Dehydrated skin needs both internal and external care.

Myth 11 - “Sunscreens Will Damage Skin in the Long Run”
Truth: Sunscreen is perhaps the most important skin care product you should have in your daytime routine. Sun damage causes tanning, dryness, premature aging, and even the chances of skin cancer. Use natural sunscreens made with hydrating ingredients to protect your skin and your skin will thank you. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or 50 and PA +++ so that you are protected against both UVA and UVB rays of the sun. 

Myth 12 - “Toners are Overrated - You Don’t Need Them”
Truth: Modern toners aren’t the astringents of the ’90s! Hydrating toners with ingredients like glycerin or rosewater replenish moisture, balance pH, and prep skin for serums. Skip alcohol-heavy formulas.

Myth 13 - “DIY Face masks only work, You do not need any special face pack”
Truth: Specialized face masks that target skin issues like fine lines, dullness, or acne are difficult to make at home. You can use DIY face packs for regular skincare and well-formulated natural face masks for treating various skin issues.

Common myths about skincare
Since skincare and beauty myths are rife, Armani beauty is here to share professional advice to help keep your skin in pristine condition. Here are some common skincare myths you might have encountered:

If you have oily skin, you don’t need to moisturise
We should all be exfoliating
Having dehydrated skin is the same as having dry skin
Only oily skin types get blemishes
If your makeup has SPF, then you don’t need to worry about sunscreen
Treating a skincare myth as fact may be detrimental to your complexion, so let’s investigate these misconceptions further.


Myth: Oily skin types don’t need moisturiser
When it comes to myths about skincare, this particular one gets circulated often. Since excessively oily skin can feel impossible to manage, adding more moisture seems counterintuitive. However, excessively oily skin is in essence unbalanced; and if the skin is deprived of moisture it can respond by producing more oil, thus adding to existing skin concerns. Instead of skipping moisturiser, ensure that you are using a product that is formulated for oily skin so that it keeps your skin balanced while providing the hydration it needs.

Myth: Everybody should use an exfoliator
Using an exfoliating scrub or chemical exfoliant is a great way to slough away dead skin cells, unclog pores and encourage brighter, healthier-looking skin to the surface. When we hear about the various benefits of a product, it can be easy assume that we must use it too; this is how some common skincare myths gain traction. The truth of the matter is, not everybody will need to exfoliate – at least not often. While exfoliants adeptly regulate oil and dissolve impurities, they can have a drying effect on the skin which can be too harsh for sensitive or excessively dry skin types. Over-exfoliation can disrupt the skin moisture barrier, causing redness, tightness and flaking.

Oily and blemish-prone skin types tend to benefit most from exfoliation and can often incorporate this step into their skincare routine several times per week – sometimes even daily. If you have dry or sensitive skin that’s looking a little lacklustre but you’re concerned about being able to tolerate an exfoliant, we suggest reading our guide to exfoliating your face. You may also want to try a nourishing formula like Crema Nera Reviving Volcanic Black Gel Mask and observe how your skin responds.
Myth: Dry and dehydrated skin are the same thing
When discussing skin dryness, it’s easy to conflate having dry versus dehydrated skin. In the spirit of demystifying this skincare myth, we want to establish the key difference between the two: dry skin is a skin type, while dehydrated skin is a skin concern. Skin dehydration points to a lack of water in the body – often influenced by lifestyle changes – and can affect a multitude of skin types. Conversely, dry skin types lack natural oils and is typically tight, flaky or red. Those with dehydrated skin can increase their water intake and water-dense foods, whereas dry skin types will need to seek out hydrating skincare products that help the skin retain moisture. Opt for Crema Nera Supreme Reviving Light Cream for 24-hour hydration and instant radiance.

Myth: Breakouts only affect oily skin types
A common skincare myth around blemishes is that they only affect people with oily skin. Because dry skin lacks moisture, the skin can compensate by generating additional oil. This can lead to a buildup of oil, bacteria and dead skin cells, all of which can clog pores and contribute to breakouts. For dry skin types, especially those prone to sensitivity, it’s important to avoid drying out the skin or sensitising it further with stringent ingredients. Instead, make sure you keep your skin nourished day and night with moisturiser and opt for breakout-friendly cosmetics like Luminous Silk Foundation which covers redness but doesn’t cling to dry patches.

Myth: You don’t need sunscreen if your makeup has SPF
Beware of any sunscreen myth that says you can skip your sun protection if your makeup is formulated with SPF. If you are depending solely on your foundation, primer or any other cosmetic for sun protection, it won’t be enough to protect you from harmful UVA and UVB rays; think of it more as a supplementary layer. Instead, always apply a sunscreen under your makeup – SPF 50 is ideal – and follow with makeup that is formulated with sunscreen like our UV Master Primer which has SPF 30+ to keep your skin well-protected.

Now that you’re well-versed in some of the biggest skincare myths, discover how you can avoid common mistakes in anti-ageing skincare routines.

Skin care advice is everywhere. It has been very popular on social media and many influencers are constantly posting or marketing different skincare products. It is imperative to know that not all of these skincare products are backed by science. Some common skincare myths can do much more harm than good. It is time to get rid of some of the biggest skincare misconceptions and hopefully get you one step closer to creating a skincare routine that is effective and suited to your specific skin needs. 

Myth #1: Sunscreen is only necessary on sunny days 

No matter what the weather is outside, cloudy or sunny, individuals should be wearing sunscreen daily. It is vital to protect your skin even on cloudy days because ultraviolet rays can still penetrate through the clouds and create damage to the skin. Since sunscreen is the number one anti-aging skin care product, it is definitely crucial to include it in a skincare routine for the face on a daily basis. Not only is sunscreen essential daily, but it needs to be reapplied several times throughout the day. 

Myth #2: Expensive skincare products and brands are always better

Skincare is definitely not a “one size fits all.” Thus, just because a product is more expensive does not mean it is more effective by any means. Although there may be some expensive products that are better overall, that is not always the case. It is essential to check active ingredients in skincare products and not just choose the most luxurious brands because of the misconception that high price always equals high quality. 

Myth #3: Oily skin does not need moisturizer 

Moisturizer is crucial for all skin types, especially in the winter months. If you have oily skin, skipping moisturizer might seem like it is the right thing to do, but it can actually worsen the skin. When skin lacks hydration, it may actually produce even more oil to compensate. There are many different moisturizers specifically for oily skin that can help both hydrate the skin and prevent it from getting oiler.  

Myth #4: Exfoliating should be done daily

If exfoliating is done daily that can definitely cause over-exfoliation, which can strip the skin of natural oils and lead to both irritation and sensitivity. Typically, it is best to limit exfoliating to two to three times per week, depending on each individual’s skin type. This is the best way to exfoliate and remove dead skin cells, while keeping the skin barrier from damage. 

Myth #5: Not washing your face everyday is what causes acne

Although not washing your face has the potential to trigger or worsen acne, it is not simply the only cause of an individual’s acne. The causes of acne are multifactorial–including stressors, hormones, environmental and genetics. There are many individuals who never wash their face with clear skin and there are also many individuals who wash their face regularly and have acne. This is definitely one of the major acne myths and it is crucial to know this is not the only cause of acne in order for patients to understand the causes and find the right treatment. 

Skincare should be based on science, not myths. Understanding what works for your skin will help you build a routine that keeps your skin healthy and glowing. If you are having trouble finding science-backed information or reacting badly to different products, it is best to consult with a dermatology provider about your skin care routine.
