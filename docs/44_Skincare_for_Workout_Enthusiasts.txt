Skincare for Workout Enthusiasts
Sweat, friction, and frequent showers affect active individuals’ skin. A simple routine prevents breakouts.

Cleanse face and body after workouts. Apply lightweight moisturizer post-shower.
3. Use SPF if exercising outdoors. Wear breathable clothing.

Keep gym towels clean. Avoid heavy makeup during workouts. Use non-comedogenic body lotions.

Don’t scrub aggressively after sweating. Persistent body acne may require medical care.
