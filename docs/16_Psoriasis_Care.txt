Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin condition with red, scaly patches. It requires gentle daily care and sometimes medical therapy.

Steps: Cleanse with non-soap cleansers. Apply thick, fragrance-free moisturizers.
3. Use medicated creams with corticosteroids or vitamin D analogues (as prescribed). Protect skin with sunscreen.

Tips: Oatmeal baths can soothe itching. Stay hydrated and manage stress, which worsens flares. Monitor triggers such as cold weather or infections.

- Avoid harsh scrubs or tanning beds.
- Severe cases may need systemic medication.
