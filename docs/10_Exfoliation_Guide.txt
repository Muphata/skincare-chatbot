Exfoliation removes dead skin cells, revealing smoother and brighter skin. Overdoing it can damage the barrier, so moderation is key.
Choose chemical exfoliants (AHAs, BHAs) or gentle scrubs depending on skin type.  Exfoliate 1â€“3 times per week, not daily. Follow with a moisturizer to restore hydration. Always apply sunscreen after exfoliation.

AHAs (glycolic, lactic acid) are great for dry skin. BHAs (salicylic acid) work best for oily/acne-prone skin. Enzyme exfoliants (papaya, pumpkin) are gentle options. Avoid mixing multiple exfoliants at once.

Redness, burning, or peeling = over-exfoliation.
