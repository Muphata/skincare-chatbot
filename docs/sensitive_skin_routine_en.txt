Sensitive skin reacts easily to products, weather, or even stress. Redness, burning, or itching are common. This guide focuses on soothing and protecting the skin barrier.
Cleansing: Use a fragrance-free, non-foaming cleanser once or twice daily. Treatment: Stick to calming ingredients like aloe vera, centella asiatica, or niacinamide. Apply a hypoallergenic cream rich in ceramides or colloidal oatmeal. Use a mineral sunscreen with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.

Always patch test new products before full application. Keep your skincare routine simple with fewer products. Store some products in the fridge for a soothing effect. Avoid alcohol, strong acids, and heavy fragrances. If irritation persists despite gentle care, seek medical advice.
