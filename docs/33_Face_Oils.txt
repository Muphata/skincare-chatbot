Face oils lock in moisture and nourish the skin. Choosing the right oil is key.

Apply after moisturizer to seal hydration. Use 2â€“3 drops, warmed in palms.
Massage gently into skin. Can be mixed with moisturizer for extra softness.

Jojoba and rosehip oil suit most skin types.
Argan oil is excellent for dry skin. Tea tree oil works for acne-prone skin (spot treatment).

Avoid heavy oils if you have acne-prone skin. Always patch test new oils.
